 desc_new_world_i:0 "Fueled by legends of great wealth, European nations sought a route to India by any means necessary. Colonialism represents the philosophy of conquest in the name of God and gold, and effected the establishment of colonial companies and grants and the acquisition of entire continents all in pursuit of profit and prestige. As new lands came under the control of European nations, a great exchange of goods, ideas, flora, fauna, and more took place, and the \"Triangle Trade\" as it would come to be known was born. As knowledge of the world grew, the world itself seemed to shrink, and new ideas about faith, philosophy, politics and others sprung forth. No matter the effects of colonialism, one thing is for sure: the world will never be the same."
