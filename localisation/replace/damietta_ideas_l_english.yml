 #Bulgaria

 bul_idea_1:0 "Legacy of Empire"
 bul_idea_1_desc:0 "Few other nations can claim to have existed in imperial form at any point in their history. Even fewer can claim two distinct empires with their name. Though hard times may befall us, the legacy of the First and Second Bulgarian Empires pervades our people, and inspires us to fight for a Third."
 bul_idea_3_desc:0 "We have seen time and time again the pitfalls of bickering nobility and internal feuds. No more! If we are to stand strong, we must stand as one."
 bul_idea_5_desc:0 "The Bulgarian Orthodox Church is the first Orthodox Slavic autocephalous Church. Once the source of great pride and power it was degraded during the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria and its decay continued during our internal struggles and fall from Imperial grace. Strong once again, the Bulgarian people will find the Bulgarian Church the chief pillar of their society once again. As it once was so shall it be again."
 bul_idea_7:0 "Bulgarian Coronation"
 bul_idea_7_desc:0 "The strength of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church is a powerful phenomenon. The power its patriarchs hold is conveyed unto the Tsar during each and every coronation. However, one key Christian figure is missing at each ceremony: the Patriarch of Constantinople. By ensuring his presence at coronation ceremonies, the Tsar's legitimacy is further solidified as coming from God."

 #Albania
 
 all_lands_under_skanderbeg:0 "All Lands Under Our Flag"
 all_lands_under_skanderbeg_desc:0 "Though our geography is diverse, one cannot dispute that each and every nook and cranny in our realm flies the Albanian flag. By using this flag as a symbol of national pride, we can increase recruitment and field a larger army."

 #Serbia

 bastion_of_orthodoxy_desc:0 "Unlike some others, our commitment to the Orthodox tradition is unwavering. Greek-style churches are the norm in our lands, and icons of saints and apostles line their walls. The Serbian Orthodox Church is among the strongest in all Europe, and its long history inspires our people, reassuring them that despite whatever may come, the Church will live on."

 #Mamluks

 red_sea_trade:0 "Mediterranean Trade"
 red_sea_trade_desc:0 "Silk and other goods from as far away as China pour through our markets and ports, finding their way to Europe. Through an aggressive system of fees and taxes on trade, as well as reminding foreigners of the importance of stable trade in the Levant, we can ensure that our mercantile presence is strong and ever-present."
 mam_army_reform_desc:0 "Though our victory over the Ayyubids is far in the past, memories of the fall of the once-strongest power in the Levant at our hands remain. Nevertheless, some of our soldiers have grown too enamored with the past and have eschewed newer techniques and strategies. Let us remedy this."
 reform_fellah_system:0 "Oases and Canals"
 reform_fellah_system_desc:0 "The desert is unforgiving. Agriculture is nigh impossible, and herding is not stable enough to feed a nation. However, we have been granted one key blessing by Allah: plentiful oases and rivers. Through proper utilization, we can harness this fresh water for farming and stabilize the basis of our nation."
 reformed_succession_desc:0 "The proud tradition of allowing the sons to fight it out for succession does lead to a bit of instability. Infidels in the west know a thing or two about this and know how to ensure that succession laws are clear, leading to greater stability. We will adopt some of these European traditions, and integrate them into existing succession laws."

 #Rum

 rum_abul_fath_desc:0 "We have enemies in all directions, making a strong army a necessity for a state such as ours. Fortunately we are not a weak people. From the irregular Gazis and the Akinci raiders to the fearsome cavalry of Timur's empire, the world have come to know the military might of the Turkish people. Let us build an army for an Empire, taking inspiration from wherever military competence can be found while also drawing from the strengths and experiences of those that came before us."
 rum_king_of_the_east_and_west_desc:0 "It is our right to rule across all the Dar al-Islam! Many times Allah's will has been made clear, first at the Second Battle of Köse Dag, then again when even the great conqueror Timur saw the righteousness of our rule. Let us expand to the east, the west, the north, and the south, until all have seen the glory of Rûm!"

 #Cyprus
 
 king_of_jerusalem:0 "Crusader Kings"
 king_of_jerusalem_desc:0 "In 1220, the victorious Fifth Crusade led to the establishment of Damietta, a Crusader Kingdom in the heart of Egypt. Ever since, the Kingdom of Jerusalem's position has been stabilized in the Levant and it is now known to the Saracens that the Crusaders are here to stay in the Holy Land. In Cyprus it is now considered our holy mission to spread the Crusade beyond the borders of Jerusalem, to secure the Levant once and for all."
 raid_turkish_commerce:0 "Raid Byzantine Commerce"
 raid_turkish_commerce_desc:0 "While at one point the Orthodox and Catholics were one and the same, it is now clear to us that the Greeks have strayed too far. At every twist and turn, the Byzantines are more interested in reclaiming their own territories than working with the Latin Church. It is only fair that the wealth of Greek ships is confiscated for the good of the Crusader Kingdoms.  After all, Pirates may be the enemies of all nations, but privateers are merely contracted businessmen, right?"
