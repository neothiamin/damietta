 hun_vanquish_vlachs_title:0 "Vanquish the Vlachs"
 hun_vanquish_vlachs_desc:0 "Ever since the appointment of Andrew V's son, Károly, as Voivode of Wallachia by the Bulgarians in 1333, the Wallachians have been a thorn in our side. Their raids ravage our lands and they coerce Saxons and Cumans to migrate to their lands rather than settle in ours. We must subjugate the Vlachs for our and their own good."
 hun_tame_the_lions_title:0 "Tame the Lions"
 hun_tame_the_lions_desc:0 "The Bulgarian empires of old may be gone, but Bulgaria itself still poses a threat to us. Though we granted our protection to the Voivode of Vidin after the fall of the Second Bulgarian Empire, further steps must be taken to secure our lands from the Bulgarian menace."
 hun_bosnia_title:0 "Banate of Bosnia"
 hun_bosnia_desc:0 "During Laura and Lukacs' rule, the Banate of Bosnia aligned itself with Serbia and broke away from us. At the time the Serbian Empire was not a force to be reckoned with, and so we had to live with the loss of Bosnia. No more! We must retake the Bosnian lands and show that we are the true rulers of Bosnia!"
 hun_bosnia_mission_trigger.tt:0 "Own or have a subject own the lands of the former §YBanate§! of §YBosnia§!"
 hun_overwhelm_eagle_title:0 "Overwhelm the Eagle"
 hun_overwhelm_eagle_desc:0 "Serbia is but a shadow of its former self. Their Empire, though not as grand or strong as the Bulgarians', was fierce and fearless. This is no longer the case. In the days of old, Serbia maintained its independence through diplomacy. Now, the time for diplomacy is over. We must conquer Serbia and establish a new Banate!"

 hun_ostsiedlung_mission_desc:0 "The migration of Saxons to the east, known as \"Ostsiedlung,\" is a contentious phenomenon among our populace. Some, such as the traders and craftsmen, wholeheartedly welcome Saxons into their towns and cities, while others, especially farmers and nobles, loathe the Germans, seeing them as a pest. It is time that we take a stand on the settlement of Saxons in our land."

 hun_danube_ports_title:0 "Danubian Ports"
 hun_danube_ports_desc:0 "The mighty Danube flows like an artery through our nation, carrying goods and ideas from Germany in the west to the Black Sea in the east. As the river twists and turns, towns pop up on its banks, hoping to profit from shipments passing downriver. By sponsoring the establishment and growth of important villages and towns along the Danube's banks, we can enrich our nation and spread our influence from Németország to the Fekete-tenger."

 hun_black_sea_coast_title:0 "Black Sea Trade"
 hun_black_sea_coast_desc:0 "The Black Sea is a hub for trade from all around Europe and Asia. Traders from 'Rus, Central Europe, the Levant, Persia, and elsewhere all congregate in the Black Sea, trading in ports such as [285.GetName], [3165.GetName], [330.GetName], [328.GetName], and even [151.GetName]. While many of these ports are not suitable for us to conquer, possessing even one port on the Black Sea coast that is suitable for commercial trade would be incredibly beneficial to us."

 hun_adriatic_coast_title:0 "Adriatic Ports"
 hun_adriatic_coast_desc:0 "The Adriatic is dotted with great market cities like Venice, Trieste, and Ragusa, and the Adriatic is the first waterway west of Greece. Needless to say, control of even one trading port on the Adriatic coast would benefit us greatly."

Acropolises, with \"acropolis\" meaning \"above the city,\" were quite common in Ancient Greece, and served as hubs for the cities in which they were located.
