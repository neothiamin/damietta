 CTR_ideas_1_desc:0 "Tripoli has long been overlooked. Our lands are not as rich as Egypt, our churches and holy sites not as famous as Jerusalem's. Let us harness this unfair treatment and use it in battle!"
 CTR_ideas_2_desc:0 "Tripoli was one of the first states established during the Crusades. Though other lands claim our name, there is only one real Tripoli."
 CTR_ideas_3_desc:0 "The mountains in the eastern regions of our nation are famed for their strong cedar trees. By harvesting and treating these trees' wood, we may build bigger and better houses, marketplaces, and palaces."
 CTR_ideas_4_desc:0 "At every turn, the tourist will find themselves confused by our terrain. This is doubly true for any invaders. Our soldiers are masters of the hills, mountains, valleys, and shores."
 CTR_ideas_5_desc:0 "Through shrewd commercial practice and slight embellishment, we may establish and maintain better trade networks with the merchants of the West and the East."
 CTR_ideas_6_desc:0 "We are undefeatable! Our troops are many, and fire burns in their hearts! Of course, a few allies for defensive purposes couldn't hurt..."
 CTR_ideas_7_desc:0 "We cannot rely on others for our own well-being. The only one you can trust in the heat of battle is the Tripolitanian next to you. Charge forth!"

 DMI_ideas_1_desc:0 "Immediately following the Fifth Crusade, our ports were flooded with merchants speaking a sing-songy tongue and gesturing with their hands while they speak. We're not entirely sure what they were trying to tell us, but we have leased land to them in our cities, bringing us closer to the markets of Italy and beyond."
 DMI_ideas_2_desc:0 "Much of the interior of our realm is desert, and the Nile's floods do us no favors when trying to build along the rivers and streams that pervade our nation. By harnessing the Nile's deposition of soil, however, we can expand into the sea rather than fear it."
 DMI_ideas_3_desc:0 "Our cause is rightous! Our orders come directly from the Lord in Heaven above! We are guided not by the words of men, but by His holy word! To battle!"
 DMI_ideas_4_desc:0 "When our nation was established, the title of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was made semi-elective, so that no one nation may exert too much control. This is foolish. Let us reform our governmental structure, for the good of us all."
 DMI_ideas_5_desc:0 "Alexandria, Damietta, Rosetta... the list of ancient and noble cities under our rule goes on and on and on. Truly, we are the heirs to the mysteries of Egypt!"
 DMI_ideas_6_desc:0 "We live by the sea's gifts. Its waters guide our ships, its fauna feeds our people. We were born to master the seas."
 DMI_ideas_7_desc:0 "When one thinks of religious societies, one normally conjures the image of a shadowy cabal meeting in catacombs or abandoned temples. Hogwash! Our societies are more like clubs, festive and jovial! Come one, come all, come to your local society hall!"

 voivode_ideas_1_desc:0 "For decades, our lands have been seen as secondary to those of the \"true\" Bulgaria. Our mission now should be one of reconquest and consolidation, not of outward expansion."
 voivode_ideas_2_desc:0 "Our ancestors, the Bolghars, were famed horsemen. Now, our soldiers are feared whether on foot or on horseback. On four legs or two, [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers strike fear into the hearts of our enemies."
 voivode_ideas_3_desc:0 "We learned very early on the pitfalls of centralized rule. Indeed, our own nation was born out of rebellion against a tyrannical ruler. We must delegate if we are to remain whole."
 voivode_ideas_4_desc:0 "Saint Cyril, Patron Saint of the Slavs, is famous for developing the Glagolitic script, which he used in his missions to the Balkans alongside Saint Methodius. Cyril is an example to us all, and a sign that the Faith knows no language."
 voivode_ideas_5_desc:0 "Old Church Slavonic, the script used by the clergy, has a long and storied history. Accordingly, it is nigh on impossible to learn. By reforming the language, we can ensure that more of our people are well-educated, for the good of the realm."
 voivode_ideas_6_desc:0 "Our land's landscape is breaktaking, from mountains to valleys, from forests to hills, from grasslands to riverbeds. By working with and not against the land, we can build greater cities and gather greater wealth."
 voivode_ideas_7_desc:0 "Though Rome proper is long gone, the legacy of Rome remains. Through our own history, we can claim the prestige of the Roman Empire and mold it into our own."
