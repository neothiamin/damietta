 damietta_byzantine_reform_1_desc:0 "A parallel to the term \"Frankokratia,\" this term describes the Byzantine Empire following its restoration. Though the Nicean court brought about the term \"Hellene\" to refer to the people of the Byzantine Empire, the revival of the Empire proper by the Palaiologoi spelled the end of the development of any \"Hellenic\" identity.\n\nThough one would think that such a restoration would spark a golden era for the Empire, many issues persisted from before the Fourth Crusade, and some new ones took hold. The Byzantine Army was still woefully small from the collapse of the theme system, leading the Empire to rely more and more on mercenaries, and the Empire was still plagued with poor finances, stemming partially from the prevalence of Italian merchants in Byzantine ports."
