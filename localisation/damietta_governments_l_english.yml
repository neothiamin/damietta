 #Byzantium Reforms
 damietta_byzantine_reform_1:0 "Rhomaiokratia"
 damietta_byzantine_reform_1_desc:0 "A parallel to the term \"Frankokratia,\" this term describes the Byzantine Empire following its restoration. Though the Nicean court brought about the term \"Hellene\" to refer to the people of the Byzantine Empire, the revival of the Empire proper by the Palaiologoi spelled the end of the development of any \"Hellenic\" identity.\n\nThough one would think that such a restoration would spark a golden era for the Empire, many issues persisted from before the Fourth Crusade, and some new ones took hold. The Byzantine Army was still woefully small from the collapse of the theme system, leading the Empire to rely more and more on mercenaries, and the Empire was still plagued with poor finances, stemming partially from the prevalence of Italian merchants in Byzantine ports."
 mechanic_damietta_byzantium_co_emperors_yes:0 "Allows for the selection of co-emperors."

 #Crusader Reforms
 damietta_crusader_tier_1_reform_1:0 "Crusader Kingdom"
 damietta_crusader_tier_1_reform_1_desc:0 "Ever since the end of the 11th Century, Europeans (predominantly those from Western Europe) have been aspiring to retake the Holy Land in the name of Christendom. These Crusades, marked by a sense of duty and fervor coupled with incredible belligerence and disdain for the lifes and cultures of native populations, saw various levels of success, from the successful First Crusade to the abject failure that was the Fourth Crusade to the mild but still significant Fifth Crusade.\n\nThis nation has taken the mantle of the Crusader cause, and seeks to establish solid Christian rule in the Levant and elsewhere."
 damietta_zealot_faction:0 "Zealots"
 damietta_zealot_faction_FACTION_DESC:0 "Zealots are warriors of the faith, always willing to take up arms against heathens and heretics. They will always advocate for war against the \"Saracen,\" or really anyone they see as blasphemous."
 damietta_zealot_faction_influence:0 "Zeal"
 damietta_pilgrim_faction:0 "Pilgrimage Keepers"
 damietta_pilgrim_faction_FACTION_DESC:0 "The Keepers maintain the ways and prayer sites that are taken by pilgrims in our lands. They meet people from across the Mediterranean and occasionally beyond, and are tasked with guiding these pilgrims to their destination."
 damietta_pilgrim_faction_influence:0 "Openness"
 damietta_clergymen_faction:0 "Missionaries"
 damietta_clergymen_faction_FACTION_DESC:0 "Missionaries are tasked with spreading the Good News among those who have not seen the light. They will always advocate for more funding and patronage for themselves, no matter the cost."
 damietta_clergymen_faction_influence:0 "Fervor"
 damietta_crusader_tier_1_reform_2:0 "Theocratic Monarchy"
 damietta_crusader_tier_1_reform_2_desc:0 "Theocratic monarchies draw influences from both pure theocracies and despotic realms. Seldom does anything happen without the King's permission, though the clergy always have the King's attention. In this nation, God rules; the King is just keeping the seat warm."

 #Muslim Reforms
 damietta_rahulid_sultanate_1:0 "Sultanate Min Omar"
 damietta_rahulid_sultanate_1_desc:0 "Founded by Omar Rahul in 1248, the Rahulid Sultanate has developed a unique system of governance. With a historical power base in Cairo and little elsewhere, the Sultanate min Omar as it has come to be known utilizes a system similar to Iqta' systems practiced elsewhere, where the Sultan confers land onto subjects who in turn pay tax in the form of grain, coin, or another good depending on the landscape. One muqti may pay his tax in grain the farms located in his province, another in sugar from his own personal plantation along the Nile, another in coin that local traders make selling goods.\n\nThe difference lies in the nature of the muqtis and how they come to administer their land; while nominally appointed by the Sultan, often muqtis will govern the same land that their ancestors governed, whether it be their father, their uncle, or sometimes even their mother or grandmother. This leads to greater stability in the various provinces of the Sultanate, but also leads to greater landholder influence, which the Sultan must respect to remain in power."
 mechanic_damietta_rahulid_sultanate_nobility_yes:0 "Utilizes a unique type of Iqta' system."

 #Rum Reforms
 damietta_rumi_sultanate_1:0 "Rûmi Sultanate"
 damietta_rumi_sultanate_1_desc:0 "Taking inspiration from the old Persian satrapies, traditional Turkic diplomatic delegation techniques, and the Byzantine \"theme\" system of military organization, the Rûmi Sultanate is unparalleled in its ability to sustain internal and external attacks. Through its eclectic style of governance, Rûm has been able to find strength from within while being able to exert power without, and has thus maintained its dominant position throughout the Mediterranean, Levant, and Mesopotamia for over four hundred years.\n\nThere is a saying among the Turkic population in Rûm: \"Rum is a mighty river; stable yet fierce, gentle yet powerful, with the power to give life and the power to take it away.\""
 mechanic_damietta_rumi_sultanate_stability_yes:0 "Increased stability cost when stability is higher than 0, lower stability cost when stability is less than 0."
