 #Damietta
 string_start_dmi:0 "The §YFifth Crusade§!, waged from 1217 to 1220, sought to retake the Holy Land through striking at the belly of the §YAyyubid§! beast - Egypt. Fighting against an Ayyubid sultanate suddenly plunged into civil war following the death of Sultan §YAl-Kamil§!, the combined Crusader forces, lead by King Regent of Jerusalem §YJohn of Brienne§! and Grandmaster Piere de Montagut of the Knights Templar, the Crusaders captured the port city of §YDamietta§! in 1219 before pushing to Cairo, Jerusalem and finally Damascus. The County of Tamiathis was established in 1220, the crown jewel of the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nOver two hundred years later, the §YFortress of Tamiathis§! still stands, battered and weary from civil wars, internal discord, and numerous failed invasions by the §YRahulid Sultanate§! to the south. The County's conversion efforts towards the native Coptic and Muslim populations have proved disastrous. Damiettan knights and footmen patrol the streets of cities like Rosetta, Alessandrie, and Sagsic, keeping the peace through whatever means necessary. A rich Latin elite rule safely from the west bank of the Nile, across the river from the city of Damiette proper, oblivious to the hostility the populace feels towards them.\n\nDivided culturally and religiously, Damietta's position and outlook are precarious. Through clever diplomacy and pragmatic administration, perhaps the Delta can see peace once more."
 #Rahulids
 string_start_rhl:0 "The §YRahulid Sultanate§! owes its name to the first Sultan, an Ayyubid emir named §YOmar Rahul§!. Rahul capitalized on the Ayyubids' weakness and neglect of Egypt following the Fifth Crusade and orchestrated a peaceful coup for Egypt in §Y1248§!, to which the Ayyubid Sultan Al-Ashraf Musa, plagued by strife in Syria and old age, did not react. Omar Rahul had captured the Breakbasket of the Mediterranean without shedding a single drop of blood.\n\nOr, at least, he seized Egypt south of the Nile Delta. To the north lied the §YCounty of Tamiathis§!, established by Crusaders in 1220, which served (and still serves) as a significant obstacle to Egyptian prosperity. By 1444, the Damiettans and Rahulids have engaged in countless wars with little territorial change to show for it. If the Rahulid Sultanate is to establish itself as the true rulers of all Egypt, they must crush the Crusader stronghold of the Nile Delta.\n\nNot that the Sultanate doesn't have problems internally. After the sudden conversion of Sultan Mohammed \"the Lunatic\" from the Sunni tradition to the Shia tradition in 1387, the Sultanate's religious makeup has been an absolute mess. Copts, Sunnis, and Shiites all call the Sultanate home, and religious rebellion is common. Sultan Uthman has taken a laissez-faire approach to religious practice in his reign, but after him, the future is uncertain.\n\nOne other thorn in the collective side of the Sultanate is the §YBerbers§! in the Western Desert and the §YNubians§! in the south. To tame the desert would take considerable monetary expenditure, but would certainly make the Sultanate a safer place. The Nubians are less of a disturbance and more of an annoyance; the seizure of their land would provide another market for Egyptian goods and would stifle the Coptic faith's aspirations of a Coptic Egypt."
 #Byzantium
 string_start_byz:0 "§YByzantium§! might seem stable and strong now, but the claimants to the title of §YRome§! have had their fair share of struggle and strife.\n\nFollowing the intrusions by the §YSerbian§! and §YBulgarian§! Empires of yester-century, the Byzantine Empire found itself caught between a Turk and a hard place. For, indeed, the Sultanate of §YRûm§! was, and still is, breathing down the neck of the Emperor in Constantinople. While the Empire was able to fight back against the Balkan belligerents, their success in reconquest did not come for free.\n\nThe Empire had to rely more and more on §Yexternal trade§! and §Yforeign mercenaries§! to take back the land they lost, and as the Empire expanded outward, its people receded in fear - fearful of their foes, fearful of the Catholics (or §Y\"Latins\"§! as they are called - the Byzantine Empire does not recognize the Catholic tradition as legitimate) that eat away at their sovereignty, such as the §YVenetians§! in §YAttica§! and in the §YMorea§!, and fearful of the future.\n\nFor the future, that most uncertain and undefined concept, is what the Byzantine Empire has most to fear. The Latins in §YItaly,§! in the §YLevant,§! and all around Europe are ever-eager to reprimand the Empire for reneging on the §YSecond Union of Lyons,§! which many hoped would mend the §YGreat Schism§! once and for all. The Seljuks in §YRûm,§! the §YBulgarians§! and §YSerbs§! to the north, the §YItalians§! across the Adriatic, even the Empire's own internal §Yinstability§! - threats are in no short supply. The past may be gone, the future may be yet to come, but the present seems more like a curse than a gift."
 #Rum
 string_start_rum:0 "The §YRûmi§! Sultanate is a paragon of stability with a legacy of repelling threats from lands far away. The §YMongols,§! §YTimur§!'s empire, the §YByzantines§! - these and more have all entered §YAnatolia§! desiring conquest and been sent away with their tails between their legs. There's no two ways about it - Rûm is rock-solid.\n\nFor now, at least. Stability has a tendency to lead to complacency in some... and resentment in others. The §YTurks§! who make up the majority of the Sultanate's population are content with a lack of expansion, and see the stability of the Sultanate as a divine blessing. Others, though, like the §YCappadocians,§! the §YArmenians,§! the §YSyriacs,§! and basically everyone else are beginning to resent the Sultan, and the governors who promised them change if they would just support the Sultanate's higher taxes, conversion efforts, lack of attention, et cetera.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, there are still the Byzantines to worry about, the ancestral foes of the Seljuk Sultanate. They desire reconquest on their way to resurrection of the Roman Empire, and are always looking for ways to erode the legendary stability of Rûm. Their success hinges on multiple factors, but one thing is for sure: the Sultanate will not be able to sit idly by for much longer."
 #Jerusalem
 string_start_koj:0 "§YJerusalem§! has seen its fair share of tumult in the past two hundred and twenty years. From being an isolated rump state confined to the city of §YAcre§! to growing to an unprecedented size after the §YFifth Crusade,§! Jerusalem has seen the lowest of lows and the highest of highs. Or, the highest of highs up to this point.\n\nJerusalem has not yet seen its zenith, it has not yet achieved its maximum potential. The §YMamluks§! in Damascus lie across the Jordan Valley from the Holy City, and the §YRahulids§! in Egypt constantly eye the lands of the Transjordan and Gaza.\n\nIn the Kingdom's capital there lives a healthy mix of cultures and many traditions are practiced in harmony. Outside the walls, though, the land is untamed and the people hostile. §YLevantine Arabs§! and §YSyriacs§! are always considering rebellion, and if the Kingdom cannot manage its people and diplomacy, it may see itself resigned to the history books."
