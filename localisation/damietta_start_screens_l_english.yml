 #Damietta
 string_start_dmi:0 "The Fifth Crusade, waged from 1217 to 1220, sought to retake the Holy Land through striking at the belly of the Ayyubid beast - Egypt. Fighting against an Ayyubid sultanate suddenly plunged into civil war following the death of Sultan Al-Kamil, the combined Crusader forces, lead by King Regent of Jerusalem John of Brienne and Grandmaster Piere de Montagut of the Knights Templar, the Crusaders captured the port city of Damietta in 1219 before pushing to Cairo, Jerusalem and finally Damascus. The County of Tamiathis was established in 1220, the crown jewel of the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nOver two hundred years later, the Fortress of Tamiathis still stands, battered and weary from civil wars, internal discord, and numerous failed invasions by the Rahulid Sultanate to the south. The County's conversion efforts towards the native Coptic and Muslim populations have proved disastrous. Damiettan knights and footmen patrol the streets of cities like Rosetta, Alessandrie, and Sagsic, keeping the peace through whatever means necessary. A rich Latin elite rule safely from the west bank of the Nile, across the river from the city of Damiette proper, oblivious to the hostility the populace feels towards them.\n\nDivided culturally and religiously, Damietta's position and outlook are precarious. Through clever diplomacy and pragmatic administration, perhaps the Delta can see peace once more."
