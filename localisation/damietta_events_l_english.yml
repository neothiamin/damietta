After the Fifth Crusade, the establishment of the County of Tamiathis and the resurrection of the Kingdom of Jerusalem did wonders for Europe, and made knowledge and goods more easily available across the continent.\n\nHowever, land travel is still slow and merchants must still pay tolls when traveling through ports and marketplaces, and by the time goods like ivory, spices, and silk reach the shores of the Mediterranean, their prices have been inflated to an exorbinant level and their supply is short.\n\nTo remedy this, some have proposed the facilitation of a maritime trade network to reach Eastern markets. A few scholars even believe that a shorter route to the riches East may be traveled by sailing to the West, across the Oceanus Atlanticus.

One notable example is Charles of Anjou, who spent decades petitioning Popes to call a Crusade against the Byzantine Empire. Ultimately, Charles' will won out, and he launched a war against the Byzantines in 1280 which ended in resounding defeat.\n\nNow, there is another Catholic monarch with similar desires for war. [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] has sent us a letter detailing the myriad causes for holy war against the Greeks. Though obviously fueled by either potent zeal or lunacy, the benefits to the Catholic world at large could prove to be great."

After the accession of Aurel I, the title of King of Hungary (or \"Regnum,\" as Aurel preferred to be referred to as) took on a connotation less similar to \"ruler\" or \"sovereign\" and more similar to \"tyrant.\" Aurel's reforms stripped traditional landholders of their power and placed that power into the hands of those more sympathetic to him, namely the Saxons, Cumans, and Transylvanians who supported his rule and aided him in his seizure of power.\n\nHowever, Aurel's son, Marius \"the Fair\", saw the problems inherent in ruling a realm where the majority population holds a minority share of the power, and almost immediately undid much of his father's \"reforms.\" It was he who first used the title of \"Grand Prince\" in an attempt to show his people that he did not consider himself to be entirely above the more mundane matters of the realm.\n\nIt has been over 50 years since the death of Marius, though, and tensions are rising among the estates of Hungary - not just the landholders, but the clergy, who see the realm as being too sympathetic to its Orthodox neighbors, and the merchants, discontent with the [Root.GovernmentName]'s lack of focus on mercantilism.
