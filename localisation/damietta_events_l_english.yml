 damietta_italian_states.1.desc:0 "Mediterranean trade feeds and clothes all of Europe. From Stockholm to Sevilla, goods from the Mediterranean are vital in the lives of all people, from kings to cobblers. Now, we find ourselves with an interesting proposition which could greatly increase our wealth.\n\nRecently, the nation of [damietta_foreign_quarter_nation_target.GetName] has loosened local laws regarding foreign quarters, opening up auctions for the rights to establish such quarters in their cities. One city in particular, [damietta_foreign_quarter_province.GetName], seems particularly lucrative. Its coastal geography and established history as a trading hub make it a prime target for a [Root.GetAdjective] quarter. Shall we make our interest known?"
 damietta_italian_states.1.a:0 "Petition [damietta_foreign_quarter_nation_target.GetName] for rights to establish a [Root.GetAdjective] quarter in [damietta_foreign_quarter_province.GetName]."

 damietta_crusader_states.1.desc:0 "My [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]! We have received a missive from [From.GetAdjective] merchantss describing that they are interested in establishing a foreign quarter in [Root.GetName]! In exchange for special priveleges, they will be allowed to utilize our port in [Root.GetName] for their own trade efforts, resulting in increased traffic for us. What say we?"
 damietta_crusader_states.1.a:0 "Of course! This agreement is beneficial to us both."

 damietta_bulgaria.1.desc:0 "War with the Byzantines is nothing new to us. We were famously beaten back by the Byzantine Empire in 1354, and many blame the Greeks in Constantinople for the collapse of our Empire. Now, though, every true Bulgarian must band together in defense of our native land!"

 damietta_bulgaria.2.desc:0 "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!\n\nWord has reached us that the Bulgaria in [BUL.Capital.GetName] has declared a new Bulgarian Empire!

 damietta_bulgaria.2.a:0 "Submit to the rightful Bulgarian Empire."
 damietta_bulgaria.2.b:0 "We stand against false Empire, now as ever!"
 damietta_bulgaria.3.t:0 "A New Capital?"
 damietta_bulgaria.3.desc:0 "Hurrah!\n\nWith the declaration of the new Bulgarian Empire under our rule, a key question has been posed: where to hold court?"

 damietta_bulgaria.3.b:0 "Maintain the current location of the royal court."

 #Rahulids

 damietta_rahulids.1.desc:0 "Our relations with the nomads of Libya has for centuries been... spotty. While sparsely populated, the Libyan Desert is speckled with important oases such as the ones at Al-Fayyum and Bahariya. These oases are critical for trade and local government.\n\nNaturally, raids on settlements in or near the Libyan Desert are common. Nomadic peoples are drawn to the riches and luxuries found in cities along the Nile and at oases like moths to a flame. This time, the city of [Root.GetName] has fallen victim to one such raid. While there were few casualties, the local population has petitioned for something to be done."
 damietta_rahulids.1.a:0 "Fine. Send a guard patrol to [Root.Capital.GetName] to calm the locals down."
 damietta_rahulids.1.b:0 "Are we now listening to anyone who sends a petition? Even a bunch of desert-dwellers?"

 damietta_rahulids.3.desc:0 "My [Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]! Our efforts to tame the Libyan Desert have proven successful! The province of [Root.GetName] is now solidly under our control. Local farmers have begun work, and trade caravans are entering and leaving the town square regularly."

 #Renaissance
 damietta_renaissance.1.t:0 "An Old Scholar"
 damietta_renaissance.1.desc:0 "Soothsayers, mystics, seers; all throughout history, people have been claiming to possess knowledge of the unknown, or the location of a great treasure, or an elixir of everlasting life. Normally, people of this sort are not paid any mind by anyone but those with rocks for brains. Seldom though, does someone arrive in a royal court seeking patronage to seek out ancient texts...\n\nAn old man, clothed in grey, with long grey hair and a matted, knotted beard walks nearly silently down through the Royal Hall. He keeps his head down, and upon reaching [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], he falls to his knees and begs.\n\n\"Please, good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], hear my plea and grant me your grace. I come from the land of the Bulgars, from a town deep in the mountains. I have spent the last fifty years in search of the great mysteries of old Greece. From the Golden Horn to Mount Athos to the hills of the Peloponnese, and all lands in between, I have scoured old temples and libraries. I have dug through ruins, I have spent thrice my weight in gold on old manuscripts, I have sat in the courts of Emperors and petty kings alike, and my search has led me at last to you, and the lands of [Root.GetName].\n\nI know they exist, you see. The secrets of the ancient Greeks. Written by men with the minds of gods. Naught but whispers have made their way out of Greece, but I believe with your help I can bring them to you. Wealth, knowledge, strategy, all these and more may find their way to your realm, if you desire. All I need is time.\""
 damietta_renaissance.1.a:0 "You speak the truth. I can feel it. Very well."
 damietta_renaissance_patronage:0 "Extend our patronage to this scholar."
 damietta_renaissance.1.b:0 "Guards! Remove this wretch from my court!"

 damietta_renaissance.2.t:0 "Old Scholar Requests Funds"
 damietta_renaissance.2.desc:0 "The old scholar we took has made another request of us.\n\nWhen asked of his progress, he informs us all is going well and his search is proving fruitful. At the end of the conversation, he interjects:\n\n\"Well, you see...\n\nA local scribe claims to own copies of translated works by old Greek philosophers. In Latin, no less! If I had the funds, I could purchase these works from him....\""
 damietta_renaissance.2.a:0 "Very well."
 damietta_renaissance_2_a.tt:0 "Grant a modest sum."
 damietta_renaissance.2.b:0 "If you need gold, you will have to find it yourself."
 damietta_renaissance_2_b.tt:0 "Deny his request for gold."
 damietta_renaissance.2.c:0 "I am sure there is a more cost-effective way."
 damietta_renaissance_2_c.tt:0 "Negotiate with the scribe for a lower price."

 damietta_renaissance.3.t:0 "Old Scholar Requests Library"
 damietta_renaissance.3.desc:0 "Once more, the scholar whom we have granted our patronage has made a request. Rather than gold, he desires an entirely new construction project: a library! Many have questioned the... practicality of such a building, given the rarity of literacy in our realm, but he insists that a library is paramount to his studies."
 damietta_renaissance.3.a:0 "A library? Oh, fine."
 damietta_renaissance_3_philosopher_gets_library:0 "Grant the scholar's wish."
 damietta_renaissance.3.b:0 "For who? You're the only one in the keep who can read!"
 damietta_renaissance.3.c:0 "A grand idea! We shall place it in the middle of town, for all to use!"

 damietta_renaissance.4.t:0 "Scholar Requests Escort"
 damietta_renaissance.4.desc:0 "The old scholar has again come to us with a request. Rather than gold for tomes or a library for... tomes, he requests a personal guard to escort him on an expedition to the heart of Greece itself: the great city of Athens. While not strictly necessary, the scholar has expressed an extreme desire to travel to Attica. He claims his research would benefit greatly from such a trip."
 damietta_renaissance.4.a:0 "A field trip? Fine! You had better come back with an entire carriage full of old scrolls!"
 damietta_renaissance.4.b:0 "A vacation, you mean. Our soldiers ought to be out fighting, not vacationing!"
 damietta_renaissance.4.c:0 "Of course! You shall travel like a king!"

 damietta_renaissance.5.t:0 "Eureka!"
 damietta_renaissance.5.desc:0 "\"My [Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]! My [Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]!\" The words echo throughout the castle. \"My [Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]! I've done it!

 damietta_renaissance.5.a:0 "Hurrah!"
 damietta_renaissance.5.b:0 "Spread these findings far and wide!"

 #Byzantium

 damietta_byzantium.1.t:0 "Ambitions of Konstantinos"
 damietta_byzantium.1.desc:0 "The romantic ideal of the warrior-king is as old as history itself. From the Epic of Gilgamesh to the Persian Emperors Xerxes and Darius to great Julius Caesar, countless kings and emperors have personally led their armies into battle - and won. Now, young Konstantinos has requested to enter formal military training, with the intention of becoming a great general. Our great Empire has no shortage of enemies, to be fair..."
 damietta_byzantium.1.a:0 "Very well, young Konstantinos. Lead our troops into glorious battle!"
 damietta_byzantium.1.b:0 "It's suicide! You shall remain in the Palace!"
 damietta_konstantinos_mad:0 "Konstantinos is upset by this news."
 damietta_konstantinos_understands:0 "Konstantinos understands."

 damietta_byzantium.2.t:0 "Konstantinos Missing!"
 damietta_byzantium.2.desc:0 "\"My liege! My liege! Grave news! Konstantinos is missing!\"\n\nThe news shakes the royal court to their cores. Heir to the Byzantine Empire... missing? How could it be?! No note was found, no signs of foul play, no broken windows... he's just gone!"
 damietta_byzantium.2.a:0 "Egads!"

 damietta_byzantium.3.t:0 "A Dubious Request"
 damietta_byzantium.3.desc:0 "A young man enters the courtroom, clad in deep purple and bright gold. His name: Konstantinos, former heir apparent to the throne of the Byzantine Empire. His request? That we support him in a coup against his father.\n\nHe explains that his father is unjust, and his family unsupportive. \"They're weak,\" he says. \"They would rather lay about in their throne rooms than wage war against their enemies!\" He seems very passionate. Perhaps his passion could be funneled into action..."
 damietta_byzantium.3.a:0 "Scandalous! We accept."
 damietta_supporting_konstantinos_xi.tt:0 "We will support Konstantinos XI in his attempted coup."
 damietta_byzantium.3.b:0 "And support a pretender? We would never stoop so low!"

 damietta_byzantium.4.t:0 "Konstantinos' Coup"
 damietta_byzantium.4.desc:0 "The time has come. The armies are ready, the knights mounted, and the people prepared to support us in our war. To Constantinople!"
 damietta_byzantium.4.a:0 "To arms! Down with [BYZ.Monarch.GetName]!"
 damietta_byzantium.5.desc:0 "On the horizon, armies bearing the [From.GetAdjective] standard march. At the front of the formation, a tall, armor-clad figure stands draped in purple and gold. Konstantinos.\n\nThe seers warned us of this. That young Konstantinos was not taken, but had fled in self-exile, and that he would one day return to Constantinople, not to talk, but to wage war. It seems they were right. His aim: to capture the throne for himself.\n\nThe time for negotiations is over. Now, we must fight."
 damietta_byzantium.5.a:0 "Oh, Konstantinos, my own flesh and blood..."

 damietta_byzantium.6.t:0 "Shaky Succession"
 damietta_byzantium.6.desc:0 "Succession crises are as familiar to our people as the Greek language itself. In times of questionable succession, often emperors would name a co-emperor to rule alongside them. Co-emperors were often sons or other family members, but an emperor may name whoever they choose.\n\nWe find ourselves in one such situation, and many have suggested to us, perhaps with vested interests, that we name a co-emperor."
 damietta_byzantium.6.a:0 "Nominate one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s brothers."
 damietta_byzantium.6.b:0 "Nominate a popular noble."
 damietta_byzantium.6.c:0 "Nominate a famed general."
 damietta_byzantium.6.d:0 "Nominate a dear friend."

 damietta_byz_conv.1.desc:0 "We stand now in a weakened state. Our lands are ravaged by war, our enemies breathe down our throats, and the future is grim. In times like this, we normally look to God for assistance, but it seems even He may have forsaken us. As we look around ourselves, we are reminded of the prosperity of the West, of the Catholics of Italy, France, Spain, and others.\n\nA crude thought crosses the mind of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]: why can't we share in that wealth? We have the land, the people, the history, the strategic geographic positioning, we are bound together by a set of mostly common beliefs, we pray to the same God, we strive to achieve the same Perfection, et cetera. Why should a difference in beliefs, a few disagreements over mere technicalities, spell the doom for our Empire? Why can we not extend an olive branch to the West, so that they may accept us as one of them and confer unto us the same benefits that other realms have enjoyed?"
 damietta_byz_conv.1.a:0 "Send a delegation to the Pope immediately."
 damietta_byz_conv.1.b:0 "That's blasphemous! We would never stoop so low as to betray our faith!"

 damietta_byz_conv.2.desc:0 "Your Holiness, I have... strange news.\n\nYou see, a missive on Byzantine parchment and with the personal signature of the [BYZ.Monarch.GetTitle] themselves has arrived, addressed to you. As you no doubt know, the Greeks have been struggling, and it seems that the prosperity of the West has made them realize the error of their ways. The [BYZ.Monarch.GetTitle] is offering [BYZ.Monarch.GetHerHis] conversion to the Catholic tradition, if we would welcome [BYZ.Monarch.GetHerHim] back into the fold of the True Faith. The decision is yours."
 damietta_byz_conv.2.b:0 "Welcome back, dear brothers. Your sins be forgiven, for you have seen the Light."
 damietta_byz_conv.2.c:0 "A... strange gesture, but one that we cannot accept."

 damietta_byz_conv.4.t:0 "Into the Fold"
 damietta_byz_conv.4.desc:0 "The Pope has accepted our offer of conversion. This will no doubt please the Catholic monarchs of the West, and will surely lead our nation down a more prosperous path."

 #Byzantine Crusade
 damietta_byz_crusade.1.t:0 "Papal Demands"
 damietta_byz_crusade.1.desc:0 "It would seem that the Pope in Rome does not appreciate our just conquest of heretic land. Typical of a Catholic, Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has issued a \"demand\" to us: return the land back to its former owners, or face \"righteous retribution.\" The threats are surely hollow; what power does a mere bishop hold over a mighty Empire such as ours?"
 damietta_byz_crusade.1.a:0 "If \"His Holiness\" wants the land so bad, he can come get it himself!"
 damietta_byz_crusade.1.b:0 "The land is not worth a conflict."

 damietta_byz_crusade.2.t:0 "Call to Crusade"
 damietta_byz_crusade.2.desc:0 "For centuries, relations between the See and the Emperor in Constantinople have been... shaky. From petty squabbles to all-out war, the church in Rome and the throne in Constantinople have always found a way to get under each other's skin. Now, though, it seems tensions have escalated.\n\nThe Pope is calling for a Crusade against the Greeks, and has asked for our help in this effort. The goal is simple: establish Catholic realms in land held by the Greek Empire. Such a goal is lofty, but if achieved it would bolster the faith greatly."
 damietta_byz_crusade.2.a:0 "Pledge our support to the Pope."
 damietta_supporting_byzantine_crusade.tt:0 "Will be called to war against Byzantium."

 damietta_byz_crusade.3.desc:0 "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!\n\nIt would appear that the threats levied against us by the Church in Rome were not hollow, but indeed were full of substance.

 damietta_byz_crusade.5.desc:0 "Many Catholic monarchs throughout history have dedicated significant parts of their lives to combatting the Orthodox heresy in the East. One notable example is Charles of Anjou, who spent decades petitioning Popes to call a Crusade against the Byzantine Empire. Ultimately, Charles' will won out, and he launched a war against the Byzantines in 1280 which ended in resounding defeat.\n\nNow, there is another Catholic monarch with similar desires for war. [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] has sent us a letter detailing the myriad causes for holy war against the Greeks. Though obviously fueled by either potent zeal or lunacy, the benefits to the Catholic world at large could prove to be great."
