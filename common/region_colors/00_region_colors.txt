#The colors chosen for this mod come either from this website: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-chart/material-design-color-chart/ or from the national colors of a nation's flag or nation itself
#I tried to make the colors represent the nations/cultures while also making sure to not have too many in the same general area

color = { 181 72 106 } #RNW
color = { 97 97 97 } #2 - German cultures / North German Area - gray (#616161)
color = { 0 85 164 } #3 - French / France - Reflex Blue, according to Pantone. The blue used on the French flag. (#0055A4)
color = { 129 212 250 } #4 - Scandinavia - Was gonna use Pantone 301 C, but it's too similar to Reflex blue for France. So, I went with a paler blue. (#81D4FA)
color = { 200 16 46 } #5 - British - Pantone 186 C, the official red used on the British flag. (#C8102E)
color = { 0 154 73 } #6 - Gaelic / Ireland - Irish Green, *the* green that Ireland uses to represent itself. (#009a49)
color = { 0 135 99 } #7 - Latin / Italy - Pantone 18-5642 TCX, also called "Golf Green." Even though this isn't the current green used by Italy, I think it looks better. (#008763)
color = { 255 160 0 } #8 - Iberian / Iberia - similar to Flag Weld-Yellow, from the Spanish flag. As far as I could tell, there is no real pan-Iberian color or set of colors, so I'm using #FFA000
color = { 255 255 255 } #9 - Finno-Ugric / Urals - just straight white. I thought the Finnish flag might use something that's not literally (#FFFFFF) but nope! It's just pure white. It kind of works, too, because most of the Finno-Ugric cultures are in northern Siberia, where it snows a lot. I guess it snows a lot in Finland, too.... Bleh.
color = { 244 67 54 } #10 - South Slavic / Balkans - So, yeah, I won't be able to use national colors for this one, haha. I wanted to go with a purple, but I realized that purple would be better for the Byzantine cultures. So, red! (#F44336)
color = { 240 98 146 } #11 - West Slavic / Poland - I shouldn't, but I'm going with pink! (#F06292)
color = { 135 115 55 } #12 - Carpathian / Carpathia - hmm. With Carpathia having both Hungarian and Romanian cultures in its region, this one is gonna be hard. In Damietta, I went for a medium brown-ish color. I think this one might be best as like... shit man, I have no idea. Could I get away with a green? Edit: no. I cannot. Brown it is. (#877337)
color = { 255 152 0 } #13 - dummy / Low Countries - Oh, orange. Duh. (#FF9800)
color = { 27 94 32 } #14 - East Slavic / Russia - Green. Green green green green. (#1B5E20)
color = { 255 255 141 } #15 - Baltic / Baltic - I like yellow for the Baltics. I think it looks nice. (#FFFF8D) HOLY SHIT THE COLOR CODE IS HAPPY! I knew yellow was the right choice!
color = { 156 39 176 } #16 - Hellenic / dummy - PURP PURP PURP (#9C27B0)
color = { 220 220 220 } #17 - dummy / South German - Ehh. White? Like, Austrian white? I guess? Taken straight from the game files. (#DCDCDC)
color = { 4 144 178 } #18 - dummy / Ruthenia - Welp. I already did green for Russia. I hate to do it, but this blue that the game has is pretty nice... Lemme find the hex code for it. (#0490b2) Ohh, yeah, it's nice.
color = { 161 161 161 } #19 - Caucasian / Caucasia - Going back to Damietta for this one. It's kind of like a grey? The color looks nicer in game, I promise. (#A1A1A1)
color = { 0 127 0 } #20 - Arabic / Arabia - GREEN BRÖTHER! Duh! A nice, deeeep green. (#007F00)
#END OF BATCH 1
color = { 0 131 143 } #21 - Berber / Maghreb - There is apparently a Maghrebi culture group. I don't know what on earth it's for, but it's there. That said, Berber is much more prevalent. Since Arabic is already green, I'm going with a muted cyan. (#00838F)
color = { 2 119 189 } #22 - Dacian / dummy - ooo, ok, don't sue me, but what about a nice blue? (#0277BD)
color = { 55 65 92 } #23 - Maghrebi / Pontic Steppe - dark red
color = { 198 40 40 } #24 - Iranian / Persia - I'm feeling a red. (#FF5252)
color = { 144 164 174 } #25 - Altaic / Central Asia - Shit, I can't do white because the Ural region is white. Shit shit shit. How abouttaaaaa blue-grey? I guess? (#90A4AE)
color = { 46 125 50 } #26 - Central American / Mexico - I think green is fine. (#2E7D32)
color = { 255 241 118 } #27 - Aridoamerican / dummy - The fuck? Excuuuuse me? You're getting piss yellow, bud. (#FFF176)
color = { 83 109 254 } #28 - Mayan / Central America - Since Mexico is green, and Aridowhateverthefuck is yellow, doesn't it make sense for this one to be blue? Plus, the nation of Maya in-game is blue! It makes sense! I promise! (#536DFE)
color = { 206 147 216 } #29 - Otomanguean / dummy - I like the purple that was in the game at the moment I was writing this, so purple! It's more like a lilac in-game, though. (#CE93D8)
color = { 0 121 107 } #30 - Andean / Peru - Again, the game has a nice color at the time I'm writing this, it's like a teal. I like it. Teal. (#00796B)
color = { 56 142 60 } #31 - Tupi / Brazil - Hmmmm. Je is burgundy, Andean is teal... what about a green? (#388E3C)
color = { 148 30 70 } #32 - Je / dummy - This one is nice already. It's like a burgundy. Pretty. (#941E46)
color = { 255 179 0 } #33 - Marañón / dummy - What a name. Also G O L D (#FFB300)
color = { 40 121 66 } #34 - Chibchan / dummy - The game has a green here. It's nice. Keeping. (#287942)
color = { 25 72 156 } #35 - Matacoan / Upper Peru - I like the game's blue here, but I made it darker. (#19489C)
color = { 229 57 53 } #36 - Araucanian / La Plata - Reeeeeeed. (#E53935)
color = { 193 65 54 } #37 - Cariban / Caribbeans - Side note, PDX spelled "Caribbean" wrong in the game code multiple times. Come on. Anyways, uh... this red is nice. It's base game but I like it. It's staying. (#C14136)
color = { 183 28 28 } #38 - Egyptian / Egypt - Deadass, I've been moving this one down so much that I felt bad and decided to put it right here in the middle of the New World shit. Sorry, Egypt. As a reward for waiting, you're getting a beautiful color: a nice, strong, beautiful red. (#B71C1C)
color = { 171 71 188 } #39 - Waroid / Levant - Waroid cultures hardly exist so I didn't want to make a dummy culture for the Levant region. This color is like... the most neutral purple you could find. It's not deep, it's not pale, it's not bright, it's not dark. It's just purple. (#AB47BC)
color = { 30 160 203 } #40 - Oghuz / Anatolia - Bright blue. It just looks good. "nEo It'S aN iNdIgO" SHUT UP (#283593)
#END OF BATCH 2
color = { 49 185 191 } #41 - Eskaleut / Khorasan - So, I don't give two shits about Eskaleut, but I do give at least one shit about Khorasan. I'm making it the same blue as Transxoxiana. (#31B9BF)
color = { 36 109 194 } #42 - Algonquian / Great Lakes - A vanilla color. It's a blue. I like it. I like blue, if you couldn't tell. (#246DC2)
color = { 255 214 0 } #43 - "plains_algonquian" / Great Plains - So, it looks like PDX/Draiocht beat me to it! Plains Algonquian does not exist! It's a dummy group! Hahaha! So, what makes sense for the Great Plains? Gold! America's Breadbasket, baybee! (#FFD600)
color = { 130 25 74} #44 - Eastern Algonquian / Northeast (America) - Another burgundy. I like it. Shut up. (#82194A)
#END OF BATCH 3
color = { 174 213 129 } #45 - Iroquoian / Canada - Alright so deadass it's been a while. (#AED581)
color = { 255 214 0 } #46 - Siouan / dummy - Reusing the Great Plains color. (#FFD600)
color = { 207 216 220 } #47 - Caddoan / Rio Grande - Blue-grey. (#CFD8DC)
color = { 255 87 34 } #48 - Muskogean / Southeast (America) - Heck. (#FF5722)
color = { 255 236 179 } #49 - Numic / dummy - Light amber. (#FFECB3)
color = { 51 105 30 } #50 - Puebloan / dummy - Forest green. (#33691E)
color = { 123 31 162 } #51 - Na Dené / Northwest Territories - (#7B1FA2)
color = { 48 63 159 } #52 - Penutian / California - (#303F9F)
color = { 211 47 47 } #53 - Chinese / North China - Red. (#D32F2F)
color = { 194 24 91 } #54 - Korean / Korea - Magenta? (#C2185B)
color = { 2 136 209 } #55 - Japanese / Japan - Blue (#0288D1)
color = { 129 199 132 } #56 - Tibetan / Tibet - Green (#81C784)
