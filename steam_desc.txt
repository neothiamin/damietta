!! WARNING! ALPHA MOD! !!

Hi, I'm neothiamin, and this is Damietta!

Damietta is an alternative history Beyond Typus submod-of-sorts based around a successful Fifth Crusade in the year 1220. Key features include:

* Crusader Kingdoms in the Levant and (gasp) Egypt! Jerusalem, Tripoli, and Damietta proper!
* Other new nations in the Levant and beyond! A surviving Sultanate of Rum, fractured remnants of the Second Bulgarian Empire, a Mamluk sultanate in Syria, and more!
* Events to model European interests in the Levant! Establish Foreign Quarters as an Italian plutocracy, and make big bucks!
* Much more, and more to come!

A running buglist can be found here: https://pastebin.com/YCR14xqr

Former releases will be posted as necessary.

Instructions for use:
1) Download Damietta.
2) Download Beyond Typus.
3) Position Damietta ABOVE Beyond Typus in the launcher.
4) Play!

A few things to note:
* This mod ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES Beyond Typus for 1.29! It will not function correctly, or possibly at all, without it!
* This mod, as indicated at the top of the description, is nowhere near complete! Bugs will exist! Changes are always being made! Nothing is sacred! This mod is not for the faint of heart. You have been waaaarned...
