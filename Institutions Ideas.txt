I have a lot to say about the Renaissance in Damietta.

The Renaissance in Damietta, I think, would happen anywhere from 5 to 20 years later than in the base game (not to mention that saying the Renaissance just all of a sudden started in 1450 is silly and historically incorrect) and that the "spread" of the Renaissance would be a lot slower. A big part of the spread of the Greek classics was the exodus of Byzantine scholars from the Byzantine Empire following the various intrusions by the Ottoman Empire. Of course, in Damietta, the Ottoman Empire does not exist, and the mod's analog, the Sultanate of Rum, is very different with its approach to the Byzantines than the Ottoman Empire was in OTL. The Ottomans sort of focused on the weakened Byzantine Empire, to the point that the Empire had not even consolidated Anatolia by the time Constantinople fell. Now, there are other ways for Byzantium to face pressure that would cause its scholars to flee the empire, such as a Catholic Crusade or the (not yet implemented) Byzantine Civil War. These potential events will, of course, factor in to the spawning and spread of the Renaissance.

On the spread of the Renaissance, I just think that it spread tooooooo fast. Once it gets a foothold in Flanders, it spreads to the rest of the Low Countries and an independent Flanders will almost definitely do knowledge sharing with France, giving all of France the institution. From France it goes to Burgundy, from the Low Countries it goes to Northern Germany, from Venice it goes to Austria, and then bing bang boom it's all over. This is bad. I don't like it. Meh.

Colonialism Ideas
==================================

Whispers of Riches

About 90 months after the spawn of the Renaissance, a European nation that either

- has 250 dev and has at least 5 ports
- OR is a 150+ dev CAS, FRA, ENG, POR, SCO, or BRI

will get an event called "Whispers of Riches" which details, well, whispers of the riches of the East. The flavor text will mention the Silk Road, spices, Marco Polo's travels, and other stuff. This event allows them to either 

1) pursue the riches or
2) ignore the rumors, upon which another nation can get the event according to the criteria above

If a nation pursues the riches, then no other nation can get that event. Instead they get a different event where they can engage in competition.

When the event fires, the nation that first pursues the riches gets an internal variable that represents colonial interest. This is integral for the spawning of the institution in a prompt manner (i.e. before 1500). Colonialism will only spawn pre-1500 in a nation with a colonial interest variable of 100 or more. The nation that pursues the riches automatically gets 20 progress. Nations that engage in competition also get the variable, but they start at 10. Other nations can found bureaus of their own via decision, but they only get 5 progress. 

Pursuing the riches or engaging in compeition lead to more events, where the nation can send expeditions (10), send merchants to Africa or the East (5), hire cartographers (5), and other things.
